# [Fossils Viewer](http://www.dmod.eu/fossilsviewer/index.html)
This repository includes my graduate thesis around the field of Augmented Reality on Android devices.

The purpose of this application is to display a 3D fossil object in a friendly 3D environment, allowing the user to interact with it by taking advantage of the multiple gestures' detection.

At this moment the user has the ability to add comments over the 3D mesh, and can review them later by pressing a pushpin that is displayed over a comment after the addition. The comment is displayed in 2D space and follows the object so as to help the user read the comments easily.

This objects are 3D replicated meshes of real fossils from the [Perama Cave](http://spilaio-perama.gr/web/) in Ioannina, Epirus, Greece.

The user can also display these objects in real 3D space by using the built-in camera and this [image](https://code.google.com/p/andar/downloads/detail?name=AndroidPattern.pdf). In order to recognize this image pattern, this app uses the AndAR library which you can find out [here](https://code.google.com/p/andar/).
